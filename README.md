# Hey, I'm Saneth.  

I build things, startups, systems, products, whatever it takes.  

I’m a **Software Engineer** (BCU undergrad), but honestly, I don’t just write code, I create things that matter.  

## What I Work With  
I’ve used a lot of tech, but here’s what I get things done with:  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Shadcn UI, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** Node.js, PHP, C#, Python  
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL (Neon)  
- **Other:** Java, C++, React Native  

## What I’m Up To  
- Building my startup.  
- Learning, breaking things, fixing them, and improving.  
- Figuring out how to push things to the next level.  

If you're working on something cool, let's talk. Always open to new ideas.
